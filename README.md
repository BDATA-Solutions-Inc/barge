## Prerequisites

You need to have the newest versions available of both:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* Linux/MacOS. Currently Windows OS is not supported.

Populate the following in the `brizo.env` file:

* All of the `AZURE_`... related variables: necessary for `Brizo` to serve consume requests. You will get the values if you go through the [Azure Storage tutorial in the Ocean Protocol docs](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/azure-for-brizo/).

## Get Started

Then bring up an instance of the whole Ocean Protocol network stack with the `start_ocean.sh` script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docker-images.git
cd docker-images/

./start_ocean.sh
```

---

This will bring up the `stable` versions of all components, referring to their respective `master` branches.

To run as a publisher, `Brizo` configuration must be set with valid Azure account credentials. This is done in the file [brizo.env](./brizo.env).

To get the `latest` versions of all components, referring to their `develop` branches, pass the argument `--latest`:
 
```bash
./start_ocean.sh --latest
```

After getting everything running, you can open the **Pleuston Frontend** application in your browser:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Script Options

The `start_ocean.sh` script provides the following options:

Option                      | Description
----------------------------| -----------
`--latest`                  | Get the `latest` versions of all components instead of stable, referring to their `develop` branches.
`--no-pleuston`             | Start up Ocean without an instance of `pleuston`. Helpful for development on `pleuston`.
`--no-aquarius`             | Start up Ocean without an instance of `aquarius` and `mongodb`.
`--no-brizo`                | Start up Ocean without an instance of `brizo`.
`--no-secret-store`         | Start up Ocean without an instance of `secret-store`.
`--local-ganache-node`      | Runs a local ganache node.
`--local-spree-node`        | Runs a local node of the `spree` network.
`--local-nile-node`         | Runs a node of the `nile` network and connects to the `nile` network.
`--local-kovan-node`        | Runs a light node of the `kovan` network and connects to the `kovan` network.
`--reuse-ganache-database`  | Runs the ganache node with a persistent database.
`--purge`                   | Removes the containers, volumes, artifact folder and networks used by the script.

## Docker Building Blocks

Ocean compose consist of a set of building Blocks that can be combined to form a local test environment.

### Keeper Node

Controlled by the `--local-*-node` config switches will start a container `keeper-node` that uses port `8545` to expose an rpc endpoint to the Ethereum Protocol. Internal Url: `http://keeper-node:8545`.

Hostname      | External Port | Internal Url            | Description
--------------|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------
`keeper-node` | `8545`        | http://keeper-node:8545 | An Ethereum RPC node

This node can be one of the following implementations:

Node      | Description
----------|-------------
`ganache` | Runs a local `ganache-cli` node that is not persistent by default. The contracts from the desired `keeper-contracts` version will be deployed upon launch of this node.
`spree`   | Runs a local instance of the `spree` network. See [Spree Network](#spree-network) for details.
`nile`    | Runs a instance of the `nile` network and connects to the Nile testnet. See [Nile Network](#nile-network) for details.
`kovan`   | Runs a instance of the `kovan` network and connects to the Kovan testnet.

### Aquarius

Controlled by the `--no-aquarius` config switch will start two containers:

Hostname   | External Port | Internal Url         | Description
-----------|---------------|----------------------|-------------------
`aquarius` | `5000`        | http://aquarius:5000 | [Aquarius](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius)
`mongodb`  |               |                      | MongoDB used by Aquarius

### Brizo

Controlled by the `--no-brizo` config switch will start one container:

Hostname   | External Port | Internal Url       | Description
-----------|---------------|--------------------|-------------------
`brizo`    | `8030`        | http://brizo:8030  | [Brizo](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/brizo)

### Pleuston

Controlled by the `--no-pleuston` config switch will start one container:

Hostname   | External Port | Internal Url          | Description
-----------|---------------|-----------------------|-------------------
`pleuston` | `3000`        | http://pleuston:3000  | [Pleuston](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pleuston)

You can reach it on http://localhost:3000

### Secret Store

Controlled by the `--no-secret-store` config switch will start three containers:

Hostname                    | External Ports  | Internal Url                          | Description
----------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------
`secret-store`              | `12000`, `32771` | http://secret-store:12000             | An instance of the Ocean Secret Store
`secret-store-cors-proxy`   | `12001`         | http://secret-store-cors-proxy:12001  | A nginx proxy to enable CORS on the secret store
`secret-store-signing-node` | `9545`          | http://secret-store-signing-node:9545 | A parity node to `sign` messages for the secret store and to `decrypt` and `encrypt`

### Spree Network

If you run the `start_ocean.sh` script with the `--local-spree-node` option, you will have available a keeper node instance with the following accounts enabled:

Account                                    | Password   | Balance    
-------------------------------------------|------------|--------
0x00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e | node0      | 10000000111000111000111000
0x068ed00cf0441e4829d9784fcbe7b9e26d4bd8d0 | secret     | 100000000
0xa99d43d86a0758d5632313b8fa3972b6088a21bb | secret     | 100000000

Use one of the above accounts to populate `PARITY_ADDRESS` and `PARITY_PASSWORD` in `brizo.env` file to avoid asccount `locked` issues from the keeper contracts.
