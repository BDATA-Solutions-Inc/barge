## Prerequisites

You need to have the newest versions available of both:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
* Linux/MacOS. Currently Windows OS is not supported.

**To run as a publisher:** `Brizo` configuration must be set with valid Azure account credentials. This is done in the file [`brizo.env`](./brizo.env). Follow our tutorial [Set up Azure Storage](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/tutorials/azure-for-brizo/) to learn how to get those credentials.

## Get Started

Then bring up an instance of the whole Ocean Protocol network stack with the `./start_ocean.sh` script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docker-images.git
cd docker-images/

./start_ocean.sh
```

---

This will bring up the `stable` versions of all components, referring to their respective `master` branches.

To get the `latest` versions of all components, referring to their `develop` branches, pass the argument `--latest`:
 
```bash
./start_ocean.sh --latest
```

After getting everything running, you can open the **Pleuston Frontend** application in your browser:

[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Script Options

The `./start_ocean.sh` script provides the following options:

Option                      | Description
----------------------------| -----------
`--latest`                  | Get the `latest` versions of all components instead of `stable`, referring to their `develop` branches.
`--no-pleuston`             | Start up Ocean without the `pleuston` Building Block. Helpful for development on `pleuston`.
`--no-aquarius`             | Start up Ocean without the `aquarius` Building Block.
`--no-brizo`                | Start up Ocean without the `brizo` Building Block.
`--no-secret-store`         | Start up Ocean without the `secret-store` Building Block.
`--local-ganache-node`      | Runs a local `ganache` node.
`--local-spree-node`        | Runs a node of the local `spree` network.
`--local-nile-node`         | Runs a node of the `nile` network and connects the node to the `nile` network.
`--local-kovan-node`        | Runs a light node of the `kovan` network and connects the node to the `kovan` network.
`--reuse-ganache-database`  | Configures a running `ganache` node to use a persistent database.
`--purge`                   | Removes the containers, volumes, artifact folder and networks used by the script.

## Docker Building Blocks

Ocean compose consists of a set of building blocks that can be combined to form a local test environment. By default all building blocks will be started with the `./start_ocean.sh` script.

### Pleuston

By default it will start one container. This Building Block can be disabled by setting the `--no-pleuston` flag. 

Hostname   | External Port | Internal Url          | Local Url             | Description
-----------|---------------|-----------------------|-----------------------|--------------
`pleuston` | `3000`        | http://pleuston:3000  | http://localhost:3000 | [Pleuston](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pleuston)

### Aquarius

By default it will start two containers. This Building Block can be disabled by setting the `--no-aquarius` flag. 

Hostname   | External Port | Internal Url         | Local Url             | Description
-----------|---------------|----------------------|-----------------------|--------------
`aquarius` | `5000`        | http://aquarius:5000 | http://localhost:5000 | [Aquarius](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius)
`mongodb`  |               |                      |                       | MongoDB used by Aquarius

### Brizo

By default it will start one container. This Building Block can be disabled by setting the `--no-brizo` flag. 

Hostname   | External Port | Internal Url       | Local Url             | Description
-----------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------------
`brizo`    | `8030`        | http://brizo:8030  | http://localhost:8030 | [Brizo](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/brizo)

### Keeper Node

Controlled by the `--local-*-node` config switches will start a container `keeper-node` that uses port `8545` to expose an rpc endpoint to the Ethereum Protocol.
You can find a detailed explanation of how to use this in the [script options](#script-options) section of this document.

Hostname      | External Port | Internal Url            | Local Url             | Description
--------------|---------------|-------------------------|-----------------------|--------------
`keeper-node` | `8545`        | http://keeper-node:8545 | http://localhost:8545 | An Ethereum RPC node

This node can be one of the following types:

Node      | Description
----------|-------------
`ganache` | Runs a local `ganache-cli` node that is not persistent by default. The contracts from the desired `keeper-contracts` version will be deployed upon launch of this node.
`spree`   | Runs a local node of the `spree` network. See [Spree Network](#spree-network) for details. The contracts from the desired `keeper-contracts` version will be deployed upon launch of this node.
`nile`    | Runs an instance of the `nile` network and connects to the Nile testnet. See [Nile Network](#nile-network) for details.
`kovan`   | Runs an instance of the `kovan` network and connects to the Kovan testnet.

### Secret Store

By default it will start three container. This Building Block can be disabled by setting the `--no-secret-store` flag. 

Hostname                    | External Ports   | Internal Url                          | Local Url              | Description
----------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|--------------
`secret-store`              | `12000`, `32771` | http://secret-store:12000             | http://localhost:12000 | An instance of the Ocean Secret Store
`secret-store-cors-proxy`   | `12001`          | http://secret-store-cors-proxy:12001  | http://localhost:12001 | A nginx proxy to enable CORS on the secret store
`secret-store-signing-node` | `9545`           | http://secret-store-signing-node:9545 | http://localhost:9545  | A parity node to `sign` messages for the secret store and to `decrypt` and `encrypt`

### Spree Network

If you run the `./start_ocean.sh` script with the `--local-spree-node` option (please see [Keeper Node](#keeper-node) section of this document for more details).
You will have available a keeper node in the local and private `spree` network with the following accounts enabled:

Account                                      | Password   | Balance    
---------------------------------------------|------------|--------
`0x00bd138abd70e2f00903268f3db08f2d25677c9e` | node0      | 10000000111000111000111000
`0x068ed00cf0441e4829d9784fcbe7b9e26d4bd8d0` | secret     | 100000000
`0xa99d43d86a0758d5632313b8fa3972b6088a21bb` | secret     | 100000000

Use one of the above accounts to populate `PARITY_ADDRESS` and `PARITY_PASSWORD` in `brizo.env` file to avoid account `locked` issues from the keeper contracts.

### Nile Network

Please see [Nile Testnet](https://docs.oceanprotocol.com/concepts/testnets/#nile-testnet) for details.
