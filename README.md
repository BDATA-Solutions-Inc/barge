## Disclaimer

Current implementation is an **alpha version**, so you can expect running into problems. The current implementation only support assets stored in Microsoft Azure storage.

## Get Started

For local development you can use Docker & Docker Compose. To do that you need to have the newest versions available of both:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Docker

The most simple way to get started is with Docker compose:

```bash
docker-compose --project-name=ocean up
```

This will give you a local instance of Ocean Protocol.

After getting everything running, you could open the browser and access the **Pleuston Frontend** application:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Ocean components

The Ocean Docker compose starts the following components:

* **Pleuston** frontend application. Listening on port **3000**.
* **Provider backend**. Listening on port **5000**.
* **Keeper contracts**. Listening on port **8545**.
* **BigchainDB**. Listening on port on port **9984**.
