Ocean Keeper implementation where we put the following modules together:

* **TCRs**: users create challenges and resolve them through voting to maintain registries;
* **Ocean Tokens**: the intrinsic tokens circulated inside Ocean network, which is used in the voting of TCRs;
* **Marketplace**: the core marketplace where people can transact with each other with Ocean tokens.

## Get Started

For local development you can use Docker & Docker Compose. To do that you need to have the newest versions available of both:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

### Docker

The most simple way to get started is with Docker compose:

```bash
docker-compose --project-name=ocean up
```

This will give you a local instance of Ocean Protocol.

After having everything running, you could open the browser and access to the **pleuston frontend** application:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Ocean components

The Ocean Docker compose starts the following components:

* **Pleuston** frontend application. Listening the **3000** port.
* **Provider backend**. Listening the **5000** port.
* **Keeper contracts**. Listening the **8545** port.
* **BigchainDB**. Listening the **9984** port.
