## Prerequisites

You need to have the newest versions available of both:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Get Started

Then bring up an instance of the whole Ocean Protocol network stack with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docker-images.git
cd docker-images/

docker-compose --project-name=ocean up
```

After getting everything running, you can open the **Pleuston Frontend** application in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Ocean Protocol components

The Ocean Docker compose starts the following components:

* [ü¶Ñ pleuston](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pleuston). Frontend listening on port `3000`.
* [üêã provider](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider). Backend listening on port `5000`.
* [üíß keeper-contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts). RPC client listening on port `8545`.

### Versions

The version of the Ocean components can be configured setting the environment variable `OCEAN_VERSION`. By default `master` branch runs the latest stable version release, and `develop` branch runs the code generated in the `master` branch of the Ocean components. If you want to run the component's code of `develop` branch:

```bash
export OCEAN_VERSION=latest
docker-compose --project-name=ocean up
```
