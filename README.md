## Prerequisites

You need to have the newest versions available of both:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Get Started

Then bring up an instance of the whole Ocean Protocol network stack with:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docker-images.git
cd docker-images/

./start_ocean.sh
```

This will bring up the `stable` versions of all components, referring to their respective `master` branches.

To get the `latest` versions of all components, referring to their `develop` branches, pass the argument `--latest`:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh --latest
```

After getting everything running, you can open the **Pleuston Frontend** application in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

## Ocean Protocol components

The Ocean Docker compose starts the following components:

* [ü¶Ñ pleuston](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pleuston). Frontend listening on port `3000`.
* [üêã provider](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/provider). Backend listening on port `5000`.
* [üíß keeper-contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts). RPC client listening on port `8545`.

![Ocean Protocol Components](doc/img/ocean-components@2x.png)

### Options

The keeper-contracts component runs with ganache by default and every run will produce and deploy new instances of the keeper contracts.
Ganache can be run with a specific database path by setting the env var `REUSE_DATABASE` to "true". By default, the ganache database will be setup in the cwd.

The following env vars enable some customization:

* DEPLOY_CONTRACTS: skip deploying smart contracts by setting this to "false", in this case `REUSE_DATABASE` should be set to True in the previous run when using ganache
* KEEPER_NETWORK_NAME: set to one of "ganache" (default), "kovan", or "ocean_poa_net_local"
* ARTIFACTS_FOLDER: this is where the deployed smart contracts abi files will be available. This can be pointed at any path you like. When running a separate pleuston instance, it may be necessary to copy the abi files from this artifacts folder to the @oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts/artifacts folder in pleuston

A subset of the components can be run by modifying the docker-compose file directly or by using one of the other pre-built compose files:

* `docker-compose-no-pleuston.yml` runs all components without the pleuston. This is useful for developing/debugging the front-end app. So first the docker compose container can be started then pleuston can be started separately from source. You can also use `./start_ocean.sh --no-pleuston` to do this
* `docker-compose-local-parity-node.yml` is similar to the above with no pleuston, but runs a local parity POA node instead of ganache-cli. You can also use `./start_ocean.sh --local-parity-node` instead
