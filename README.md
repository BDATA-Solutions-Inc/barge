## Prerequisites

You need to have the newest versions available of both:

* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

## Get Started

Then bring up an instance of the whole Ocean Protocol network stack with the `start_ocean.sh` script:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:oceanprotocol/docker-images.git
cd docker-images/

./start_ocean.sh
```

This will bring up the `stable` versions of all components, referring to their respective `master` branches.

To get the `latest` versions of all components, referring to their `develop` branches, pass the argument `--latest`:

```bash
./start_ocean.sh --latest
```

After getting everything running, you can open the **Pleuston Frontend** application in your browser:

```
http://localhost:3000
```

### Script Options

The script provides the following options:

Option | Description 
---    | --- 
`--latest` | Get the `latest` versions of all components, referring to their `develop` branches.
`--no-pleuston` | Start up Ocean without an instance of `pleuston`. Helpful for development on `pleuston`.
`--local-parity-node` | Runs a local parity POA node instead of ganache-cli.
`--reuse-database` | Start up Ocean and reuse the Database from ganache. Helpful for development.

## Ocean Protocol components

The Ocean Docker compose starts the following components:

* [ü¶Ñ pleuston](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pleuston). Frontend listening on port `3000`.
* [üêã aquarius](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/aquarius). Backend listening on port `5000`.
* [üíß keeper-contracts](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/keeper-contracts). RPC client listening on port `8545`.

### Environment Variables

The `start_ocean.sh` script and `.env` file sets defaults for the following environment variables but you can use these in combination with the Docker Compose files for further customization, e.g.:

```bash
export REUSE_DATABASE="true"
docker-compose --project-name=ocean -f docker-compose-no-pleuston.yml up
```

Variable | Description 
---      | --- 
`REUSE_DATABASE` | The keeper-contracts component runs with ganache by default and every run will produce and deploy new instances of the keeper contracts. Ganache can be run with a specific database path by setting the env var `REUSE_DATABASE` to `"true"`. By default, the ganache database will be setup in the cwd.
`DEPLOY_CONTRACTS` | skip deploying smart contracts by setting this to `"false"`, in this case `REUSE_DATABASE` should be set to `"true"` in the previous run when using ganache
`KEEPER_NETWORK_NAME` | set to one of `"ganache"` (default), `"kovan"`, or `"ocean_poa_net_local"`
`ARTIFACTS_FOLDER` | this is where the deployed smart contracts abi files will be available. This can be pointed at any path you like.

A subset of the components can be run by modifying the docker-compose file directly or by using one of the other pre-built compose files:

Compose file | Description 
---          | --- 
`docker-compose-no-pleuston.yml` | runs all components without the pleuston. This is useful for developing/debugging the front-end app. So first the docker compose container can be started then pleuston can be started separately from source. You can also use `./start_ocean.sh --no-pleuston` to do this
`docker-compose-local-parity-node.yml` | similar to the above with no pleuston, but runs a local parity POA node instead of ganache-cli. You can also use `./start_ocean.sh --local-parity-node` instead
